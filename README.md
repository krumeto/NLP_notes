## Encoder-Decoder Models:
  - Background - A short history of neural encoder-decoder models is given with a focus on on RNN-based models. - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18ZBlS4tSqSeTzZAVFxfpNDb_SrZfAOMf?usp=sharing
  - Encoder-Decoder - The transformer-based encoder-decoder model is presented and it is explained how the model is used for inference. - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XpKHijllH11nAEdPcQvkpYHCVnQikm9G?usp=sharing
  - Encoder - The encoder part of the model is explained in detail. -  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HJhnWMFizEKKWEAb-k7QDBv4c03hXbCR?usp=sharing#scrollTo=myjTH2wFeWTU
  - Decoder - The decoder part of the model is explained in detail. - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BFgJbPSeAQE7Wz0hgqyaDJj_4wkUrXgt?usp=sharing#scrollTo=U9YCIjCPInpe
